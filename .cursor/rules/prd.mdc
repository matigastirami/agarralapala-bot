The project is a langchain based AI job finder that is next level by leveraging some tricks to find jobs directly in ATS.
The idea is to have this features:

* A telegram bot that you can chat and send commands to set your role, tech stack and location
* A job seeker agent that leverages SerpAPI and Playwright Toolkit for Langchain to trigger some very explicit queries to ATS like "(lever OR ashby OR greenhouse) {candidate_role} {candidate_location}"
* A candidate matcher agent that uses the info provisioned by the bot users to match them with the job postings that the job seeker agent collected.
* A cron job that triggers both agents in a row everyday and saves only the new job postings that have been found.
* A cron job that triggers periodic job notifications to telegram users.

What's coming in the future:
* Extend the job seeker agent to scrape workatastartup.com and "Who's hiring" posts from Hacker News to make the jobs postings base even bigger and match more candidates.
