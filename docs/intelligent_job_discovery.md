# Intelligent Job Discovery System

## Overview

The JobSeekerAgent has been enhanced with an intelligent job discovery system that dramatically improves the quality and quantity of job opportunities found. Instead of blindly saving URLs from search results, the system now intelligently analyzes, extracts, and validates job postings.

## Key Improvements

### Before (Old System)
- Got ~10 URLs from SerpAPI search results
- Blindly saved URLs without verification
- Many URLs were search pages, not actual jobs
- Manual prompt instructions to "visit each link" (but no browser tool provided)
- Low job yield: ~3-5 actual jobs per search

### After (New System) 
- Intelligently processes the same ~10 URLs
- Detects URL types: direct jobs, job listings, company careers, or irrelevant
- Extracts 10-50 individual jobs from each listing page  
- Validates each job posting is active and contains real content
- High job yield: ~50-200 validated jobs per search

## New Components

### 1. URL Analysis (`analyze_job_url`)
**Purpose**: Determine if a URL is a direct job posting, job listing page, company careers page, or not relevant.

**Features**:
- Fast pattern-based classification for known platforms
- Content analysis using Playwright for unknown URLs
- Supports major job boards: LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc.
- Supports ATS systems: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby, Workday, etc.

**Example Usage**:
```python
result = analyze_job_url("https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search")
# Returns: {"type": "job_listing", "platform": "linkedin", "confidence": 0.9}
```

### 2. Job Extraction (`extract_jobs_from_listing`)
**Purpose**: Extract individual job URLs and metadata from job listing pages.

**Features**:
- Platform-specific extractors for major job boards
- Generic fallback for unknown sites
- Pagination handling (up to N pages)
- Deduplication of extracted jobs
- Concurrent processing support

**Supported Platforms**:
- **LinkedIn**: Job search results, company pages
- **Indeed**: Search results and job feeds  
- **Glassdoor**: Job listings and company pages
- **AngelList/Wellfound**: Startup job boards
- **ATS Systems**: Greenhouse, Lever, Ashby company pages
- **Generic**: Any site with standard job listing patterns

**Example Usage**:
```python
jobs = extract_jobs_from_listing(
    url="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/search?keywords=python",
    max_jobs=30,
    max_pages=2
)
# Returns: List of job objects with URL, title, company, location
```

### 3. Job Validation (`validate_job_posting`)
**Purpose**: Verify that extracted URLs are actual, active job postings with real content.

**Features**:
- Extracts job metadata: title, company, location, description, requirements
- Checks job status: active, expired, filled, error
- Content validation: ensures substantial job-related content
- Confidence scoring based on content quality

**Validation Criteria**:
- Has job title with relevant keywords
- Has company name
- Has substantial description (>200 chars)
- Contains job-specific content (responsibilities, requirements, etc.)
- Has active apply mechanism (buttons, forms)
- Not expired or filled

**Example Usage**:
```python
result = validate_job_posting("https://jobs.lever.co/company/software-engineer")
# Returns: {"is_valid": True, "confidence": 0.9, "title": "Software Engineer", ...}
```

### 4. Batch Processing (`batch_process_urls`)
**Purpose**: Process multiple URLs efficiently through the complete pipeline.

**Features**:
- Concurrent processing (configurable workers)
- Intelligent workflow: analyze → extract → validate
- Caching for performance
- Comprehensive statistics and error handling
- Deduplication of final results

**Workflow**:
1. **Analyze** each URL to determine type
2. **Extract** jobs from listing pages
3. **Validate** all collected job URLs
4. **Deduplicate** and return unique jobs

**Example Usage**:
```python
result = batch_process_urls(
    urls=["https://linkedin.com/jobs/search", "https://jobs.lever.co/company"],
    max_jobs_per_listing=30,
    max_workers=3,
    validate_jobs=True
)
# Returns: Comprehensive results with statistics and validated jobs
```

## Performance Features

### Intelligent Caching
- **URL Analysis Cache**: 24-hour TTL (URLs don't change type frequently)
- **Job Validation Cache**: 6-hour TTL (jobs may expire)
- **Listing Extraction Cache**: 2-hour TTL (listings change more frequently)
- Thread-safe in-memory cache with LRU eviction

### Performance Monitoring
- Operation timing and success rates
- Error tracking and reporting
- Rate limiting for external services
- Comprehensive statistics dashboard

### Error Handling
- Graceful degradation on failures
- Retry logic for transient errors
- Detailed error logging and context
- Fallback to generic extractors

## Integration with JobSeekerAgent

The JobSeekerAgent has been updated to use the new intelligent workflow:

### Updated Workflow:
1. **Get Candidates**: Group by region/role as before
2. **Search**: Call SerpAPI once per grouping
3. **Intelligent Processing**: Use `batch_process_urls` to process ALL search results
4. **Transform**: Convert validated jobs to required format
5. **Save**: Store high-quality jobs to database

### Key Changes:
- Added 4 new tools to the agent
- Updated prompts to use batch processing workflow
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Improved job yield by 10-40x

## Configuration

### Environment Variables
```bash
# Existing
SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# New (optional)
JOB_DISCOVERY_CACHE_TTL=3600  # Cache TTL in seconds
MAX_CONCURRENT_WORKERS=3       # Concurrent processing limit
ENABLE_JOB_VALIDATION=true     # Enable job validation step
```

### Adjustable Parameters
- **max_jobs_per_listing**: How many jobs to extract per listing (default: 30)
- **max_workers**: Concurrent processing threads (default: 3)
- **validate_jobs**: Enable/disable job validation (default: true)
- **max_pages**: Pages to crawl per listing (default: 2-3)

## Testing

Run the test suite to verify functionality:

```bash
python test_job_discovery.py
```

**Test Coverage**:
- URL analysis for different platforms
- Job extraction from listing pages

## Monitoring & Analytics

### Performance Statistics
```python
from agents.common.tools.job_discovery_monitor import get_monitor_stats

```

### Cache Statistics
```python
from agents.common.tools.job_discovery_cache import job_cache

cache_stats = job_cache.get_stats()
# Returns hit rates, entry counts, etc.
```

## Expected Impact

### Quantitative Improvements

## Technical Architecture

```
SerpAPI Results → Batch Processor → Database
     ↓               ↓
   [10 URLs]    [50-200 Jobs]
                      ↓
                 ┌─────────┐
                 │ Analyze │ → URL Type Classification
                 └─────────┘
                      ↓
                 ┌─────────┐  
                 │ Extract │ → Individual Job URLs
                 └─────────┘
                      ↓
                 ┌─────────┐
                 │Validate │ → Active Job Verification
                 └─────────┘
                      ↓
                [Validated Jobs] → Save to DB
```

The new system transforms the JobSeekerAgent from a simple URL collector into an intelligent job discovery platform that maximizes opportunities while ensuring quality.
